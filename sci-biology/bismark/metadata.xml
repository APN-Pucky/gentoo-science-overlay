Bismark is a program to map bisulfite treated sequencing reads to a genome of interest and perform methylation calls in a single step. The output can be easily imported into a genome viewer, such as SeqMonk, and enables a researcher to analyse the methylation levels of their samples straight away. It's main features are:

Bisulfite mapping and methylation calling in one single step
Supports single-end and paired-end read alignments
Supports ungapped and gapped alignments
Alignment seed length, number of mismatches etc. are adjustable
Output discriminates between cytosine methylation in CpG, CHG and CHH context
