*mira-3.4.0.1 (08 Dec 2011)

  08 Dec 2011; Martin Mokrejs <mmokrejs@fold.natur.cuni.cz>
  +mira-3.4.0.1.ebuild, +files/mira-3.4.0.1-asneeded.patch:
  version bump and dropped the expat patch for --as-needed CFLAGS as upstream
  fixed that in a different way, the still applicable part of the patch is
  however provided under files/ but is just a cosmetic change (hence not really
  needed)
