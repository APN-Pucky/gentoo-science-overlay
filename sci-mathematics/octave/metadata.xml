  GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for
  numerical computations. It provides a convenient command line interface for
  solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing
  other numerical experiments using a language that is mostly compatible
  with Matlab. It may also be used as a batch-oriented language. Octave
  has extensive tools for solving common numerical linear algebra
  problems, finding the roots of nonlinear equations, integrating
  ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials, and integrating ordinary
  differential and differential-algebraic equations. It is easily
  extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in
  Octave's own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in
  C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.
