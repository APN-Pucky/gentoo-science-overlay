  Geant simulates the passage of subatomic particles through matter, for
  instance, particle detectors. For maximum flexibility, Geant
  simulations are performed by linking code supplied by the user
  with the Geant libraries, then running the resulting executable.
  Geant-3.* was written in Fortran, while Geant-4.* is a rewrite in C++.
