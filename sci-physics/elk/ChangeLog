*elk-1.3.15 (01 Jul 2011)

  01 Jul 2011; Honza Macháček <Hloupy.Honza@centrum.cz> +elk-1.3.15.ebuild:
  New ebuild added. Compiled with USE=lapack against lapack-atlas at my box, it
  failed tests miserably, even with a lot of segfaults. Using its internal
  lapack with USE=-lapack, it looks well. Tested OK with USE="-lapack libxc mpi
  openmp".
