*xrootd-3.1.0 (03 Dec 2011)

  03 Dec 2011; Andrew Savchenko <bircoph@gmail.com> +xrootd-3.1.0.ebuild,
  +files/cmsd.initd, +files/frm_purged.initd, +files/frm_xfrd.initd,
  +files/xrootd.confd, +files/xrootd.initd, +metadata.xml:
  XRootD isn't really a new program in this overlay. It was
  previously bundled within sci-physics/root, but now it is unbundled
  upstream and needs to be installed as a separate package in order
  to be used from ROOT.

  Aside from standard xrootd distribution, this ebuild may install
  useful pdf documentation from the official web site.

  Program was tested on ~x86 and ~amd64 with some basic setup, though
  no real production tests were done. Please note, that xrootd and
  accompany daemons do not work with root privileges any longer, so
  special xrootd user was used.

  Another note: all daemons MUST use the same config (-c
  /etc/xrootd/your._config), that's why there is only one conf.d file
  for all four daemons.
