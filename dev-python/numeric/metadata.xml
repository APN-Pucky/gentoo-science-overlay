  The Numeric Python extensions is a set of extensions to the Python
  programming language which allows Python programmers to efficiently
  manipulate large sets of objects organized in grid-like
  fashion. It contains fast array manipulation, masking, ffts, linear
  algebra and random number generator routines.
   Numeric is still needed for various packages, but is
  being slowly deprecated in favor of newer numpy.
