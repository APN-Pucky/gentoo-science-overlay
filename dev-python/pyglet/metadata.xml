    This library provides an object-oriented programming interface
    for developing games and other visually-rich applications with Python.
    pyglet has virtually no external dependencies. For most applications
    and game requirements, pyglet needs nothing else besides Python,
    simplifying distribution and installation. It also handles
    multiple windows and fully aware of multi-monitor setups.
    pyglet might be seen as an alternative to PyGame.
