ParaView is a powerful scientific visualization application, designed with the
need to visualize large data sets in mind. ParaView runs on
distributed and shared memory parallel as well as single processor
systems. Under the hood, ParaView uses the Visualization Toolkit as
the data processing and rendering engine and has a user interface
written using a unique blend of Tcl/Tk and C++.
