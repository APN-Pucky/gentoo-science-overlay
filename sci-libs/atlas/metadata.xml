   ATLAS is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
   numerical software. Currently ATLAS supplies optimized versions for the
   complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the Basic Linear Algebra
   Subroutines (BLAS) for both c and F77 interfaces. It can also build
   a subset of the linear algebra routine LAPACK library or the full
   LAPACK using the reference LAPACK from Netlib.
