The Visualization ToolKit (VTK) is an object oriented software system for 3D
computer graphics, image processing, and visualization. VTK includes a
textbook, a C++ class library, and several interpreted interface layers
including Tcl/Tk, Java, and Python. VTK supports a wide variety of
visualization algorithms including scalar, vector, tensor, texture, and
volumetric methods. It also supports advanced modeling techniques like
implicit modeling, polygon reduction, mesh smoothing, cutting, contouring,
and Delaunay triangulation.  Moreover, dozens of imaging algorithms have been
integrated into the system. This allows mixing 2D imaging / 3D graphics
algorithms and data.
