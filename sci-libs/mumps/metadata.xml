  MUltifrontal Massively Parallel sparse direct Solver implements a
  direct solver for large sparse linear systems, with a particular
  focus on symmetric positive definite matrices. It can operate on
  distributed matrices e.g. over a cluster. It has Fortran and C
  interfaces, and can interface with ordering tools such 
  as Scotch or Metis.
