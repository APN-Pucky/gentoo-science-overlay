MddNMR 1.2c

Copyright and Legal Information

Date: Aug 16, 2006

MddNMR is a program for dealing with uniformly and non-uniformly sampled (sparse) NMR spectra.
It can be used for decomposition of multidimensional NMR data into components in order 
to estimate frequencies, amplitudes and other spectral features. It also possible to 
interpolate missing time domain data points to allow regular spectra processing with FFT, LP, etc.
The following is legal information pertaining to the use of
the MddNMR program. It applies to all MddNMR source files,
executable (binary) files, configuration files, documentation
files contained in the official MddNMR archives. (Certain
portions refer to custom versions of the software, there are
specific rules listed below for these versions also.) All of
these are referred to here as "the software".
THIS NOTICE MUST ACCOMPANY ALL OFFICIAL OR CUSTOM MddNMR FILES.
IT MAY NOT BE REMOVED OR MODIFIED. THIS INFORMATION PERTAINS

This software package and all of the files in this archive
are copyrighted by the authors represented by Vladislav
Orekhov (Gothenburg University). They may

business.
If the user wishes to distribute a modified version of the
software, documentation or other parts of the package (here
after referred to as a "custom version") they must follow the
guidelines listed below. These guidelines have been
established to promote the growth of MddNMR and prevent
difficulties for users and developers alike. Please follow
them carefully for the benefit of all concerned when creating
a custom version.
You may not incorporate any portion of the MddNMR source code
in any software other than a custom version of MddNMR without
the explicit permission of the copyright holders. However
authors who contribute source to MddNMR may still retain all
rights to use their contributed code for any purpose as
described below.
The user is encouraged to send enhancements and bug fixes to
the MddNMR authors, but the authors are in no way required to
utilize these enhancements or fixes. By sending material to
the authors, the contributor asserts that he owns the
materials or has the right to distribute these materials. He
authorizes the MddNMR authors to use the materials any way
they like. The contributor still retains rights to the
donated material, but by donating you grant equal rights to

DEFINITION OF "MddNMR PACKAGE"
MddNMR is contained in an archive containing executables,
documentation and source files. MddNMR is officially distributed for
PC (LINUX) and MAC (OS X 10.3 and later). Other systems may be added in the future.
Distributors may support different platforms but for each
platform you support you must distribute a full package.

CONDITIONS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF ORIGINAL VERSION
On-line services may distribute the MddNMR archives under the
conditions following this section.
The archives must all be easily available on the service and
should be grouped together in a similar on-line area.
It is strongly requested that operators remove prior versions
of MddNMR to avoid user confusion and simplify or minimize our
support efforts. They should also notify the MddNMR authors so
that they can be informed about new versions.
