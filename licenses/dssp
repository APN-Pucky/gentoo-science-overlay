An academic license for the DSSP program
((c) W. Kabsch, C. Sander and MPI-MF, 1983, 1985, 1988)
is granted to in exchange for the following commitments:
 
I hereby certify that
 
        (1) I am an academic user at an academic research institution. In
            using the software, I will respect the interests of the authors
            and their institutions.
 
        (2) I will not use the software in commercial activities without
            a written commercial license agreement; commercial activities
            include, in particular, work under contract from a commercial
            company.
 
        (3) I will not redistribute the software to others outside of my
            immediate research group. I will suggest to other interested
            research groups to contact the authors directly.
 
        (4) I will not alter or suppress the run-time copyright message.

        (5) I will acknowledge the program authors on any publication of
            scientific results based in part on use of the program and
            cite the article in which the program was described.
 
        (6) I will report evidence of program bugs to the authors.
 
        (7) I will send the source code of any bug corrections and program
            extensions, major or minor, to the original authors, for free
            academic use. If I have made major extensions which are incor-
            porated by the authors, I reserve the right to be appropriately
            included in any future commercial license agreement.
 
        (8) I will not extract part of the software, e.g. modules or sub-
            routines, for use in other contexts without permission by the
            authors.
 
        (9) I will not use the program in the context of classified research.
